# ARITHMATHGEEK - CS50P Final Project
This is the Final Project of the CS50P online course
This final project is inspired by nerdle.

This game is the imitation of it but only for addition and substraction



## Description  :

This is a final project for HarvardX CS50P course ([CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)).

This game created by Wahyu Bornok Augus Sinurat (github account: officiel_tinkerthink)


In this game you should guess the Arithmetic Expression in 6 tries. The Arithmetic is only addition and substraction.

### GAME RULES :
1. The Goal of the game is to guess the right arithmetic expression.
2. You win only when you guess it right with the chances you have.
3. You have to input the character as much as the number of the block in a row.
4. The block initially black. it means that you still not guess it. the number of the black row is decreased incrementally as you guess it.
5. You have to input your guess by input the expression (include equal sign, operator, and with no spaces between each character).

8. The blok turns white (â¬œ) if the character you put into expession is not exist in the answer.
9. You have 6 chances to guess right the math equation.
10. You have to follow the instruction by the game, you have 10 warnings. everytime you break the rule, the warning decreased by 1.
